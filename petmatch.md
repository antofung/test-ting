Revathi Shinde's Pet Owner Profile
What kind of pet owner am I?
Revathi has grown up with a dog all her life and knows how to care for one. She lives
in a house with a big backyard so her canine companion will have a good amount of
space. Revathi works from home all week which means she will be able to give all her
attention to her new dog and finally, Revathi lives with people who also like dogs so
he/she will have a loving and caring family too.
Revathi’s Message to her paw-fect companion
